      "description": "Unnecessary cancer screening carries its own risks, including physical distress, bleeding, and even cancer itself. In some cases, especially when symptoms are absent, general cancer screening might not dig deep enough to detect the presence of cancer. By understanding your genetic makeup, you can build a targeted screening plan to accurately detect cancer, reduce side effects, and save on costs."
