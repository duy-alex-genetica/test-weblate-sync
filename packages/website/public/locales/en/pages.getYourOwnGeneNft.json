        "question": "6. Will <span>GeneNFT</span> help me make money, and how?",
        "answer": "<p>There is no guarantee of a person's ability to generate financial income from genetic data. To the best of our knowledge, there has never been a documented case of becoming wealthy through selling or renting one's genetic data.</p><p>However, the genetic information of a subset of individuals that are relevant to a particular field of study can help research efforts aimed at applying genetic information to areas such as personalized medicine, individualized specific drugs.. In these cases, research institutions are often willing to sponsor a small fee for access to genetic data analysis.</p><p><span>GeneNFT</span> owners have the right to allow or not allow anyone to access their genetic data, in return for a funding fee mentioned above, or simply for free in contribution to humanity's progress.</p><p>All authorized data access from the owner of the genome himself (which is yourself) is fully documented and transparent to the owner.</p>"
