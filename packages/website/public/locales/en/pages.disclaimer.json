This test is used for informational purposes, and it should be regarded as such.</p> <p>If you have any questions about this report or wish to speak with one of Genetica's genetic counsellors, please call 1900 599 927.</p> <h2>Risk and limitations</h2> <p>Risk of Laboratory Technical Problems or Laboratory Error:</p> <p>The certified testing laboratory has standard and effective procedures in place to protect against technical and operational problems. However, such problems may still occur. The testing laboratory receives samples collected by customers, patients and doctors. Problems in shipping to the laboratory or sample handling can occur, including but not limited to damage to the specimen or related paperwork, mislabeling, and loss or delay of receipt of the specimen. Laboratory problems can occur that might lead to inability to obtain results. Example include, but are not limited to, sample mislabeling, DNA contamination, un-interpretable results, and human and/or testing system errors. In such cases, the testing laboratory may need to request a new sample. However, upon re-testing, results may still not be obtainable.</p> <p>As with all medical laboratory testing, there is a small chance that the laboratory could report inaccurate information. For example, the laboratory could report that a given genotype is present when in fact it is not. Any kind of laboratory error may lead to incorrect decisions regarding medical treatment and/or diet and fitness recommendations. If a laboratory error has occured or is suspected, a health care professional may wish to pursue further evaluation and/or other testing. Further testing may be pursued to verify any results for any reason.</p> <h2>General Limitations</h2> <p>The purpose of this test is provide information about how a tested individual's genes may affect carrier status for some inherited diseases, responses to some drugs, risk for specific common health conditions, and/or selected diet, nutrition and/or exercise responses, depending upon the specific genetic testing that is ordered. Tested individuals should not make any changes to any medical care (including but not limited to changes to dosage or frequency of medications, diet and exercise regimes, or pregnancy planning) based on genetic testing results without consulting a health care professional.</p> <p>This test does not take into account large genomic abnormalities, chromosomal aneuploidy or complex rearrangements such as translocations. In addition, there might be rare genetic variations being tested that could not be detected by current technologies. Genetics research is also not at all comprehensive. Only a fraction of DNA variations are known to be related to health and wellness traits. Take cancer as an example, there may be genes related to cancer that clinical relevance has yet to be established with certainty. As a result, the test may not detect all variants associated with the disease being examined. Neither carrying a harmful mutation or negative genetic results will guarantee that a person might not develop the disease in the future.</p> <p>The science behind the significance or interpretation of certain testing results continues to evolve. Although great strides have been made to advance the potential usefulness of genetic testing, there is still much to be discovered. Genetic testing is based upon information, developments and testing technique that are known today. Future research may reveal changes in the interpretation of previously obtained genetic testing results. For example, any genetic test is limited by the variants being tested. The interpretation of the significance of some variants may change as more research is done about them. Some variants that are associated with disease, drug response, or diet, nutrition and exercise response may not be tested; possibly these variants have not yet been identified in genetic studies.</p> <p>Many of the health conditions that are tested are dependent on genetic factors as well as non-genetic factors such as age, personal health and family health history, diet, and ethnicity. As such, an individual may not exhibit the specific drug response, disease, or diet, nutrition and exercise response consistent with the genetic results. Based on test results and other medical knowledge of the test individual, health care professionals might consider additional independent testing, or consult another health care professional or genetic counsellor.</p>"
