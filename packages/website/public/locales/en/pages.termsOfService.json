Acceptance of Terms</h3><p>Your use of Gene Friend's Services (excluding any services provided by Gene Friend under a separate agreement) is subject to the terms of the legal agreement between you and Gene Friend set forth in these TOS and in any and all documents incorporated herein by reference. Except as specified herein, these TOS apply to any use of the Services, including but not limited to (i) submitting a saliva sample for DNA extraction and processing, (ii) uploading a digital version of your Genetic Information and interacting with it on the Web, and/or (iii) creating and using a free Genetica Account without providing your saliva sample or Genetic Information. In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these TOS. You may not use the Services if you do not accept these TOS. You can accept these TOS by (i) clicking to accept or agree to these TOS, where this option is made available to you by Gene Friend for any Service; or by (ii) actually using the Services. In this case, you acknowledge and agree that Gene Friend will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of these TOS from that point onwards. In addition, when using particular Services, you shall be subject to any guidelines or rules applicable to such services that may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into these TOS. Gene Friend may also offer other services from time to time that are governed by different terms of service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 data-fontsize=\"16\" data-lineheight=\"30\">3. Prerequisites</h3><p>Whether or not you submit your own saliva sample, a saliva sample of anyone for whom you have legal authority to agree, or otherwise provide your own Genetic Information, you use the Services and accept these TOS only when you are eighteen (18) years of age or older and have full capacity for civil acts to agree to these TOS on behalf of yourself or those for whom you have legal authority.</p><p>Neither Gene Friend's Web nor any of its Services are designed for, intended to attract, or directed toward children under the age of 18.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 data-fontsize=\"16\" data-lineheight=\"30\">4. Description of the Services</h3><p>The Services include access to the Web and personal genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva sample. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that augments or enhances the current Services shall be subject to these TOS. You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided \"AS-IS\" and are based on the current state of the art of genetic research and technology in use by Gene Friend at the time of the purchase or viewing. As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, Gene Friend is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its Users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Gene Friend provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Gene Friend may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to Users generally at Gene Friend's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Gene Friend when you stop using the Services. Gene Friend assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside the terms of these TOS or other applicable terms.</p><p>You are responsible for any Internet service fees as well as any device/ equipment which are necessary or required for your use of our Web and/or Services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 data-fontsize=\"16\" data-lineheight=\"30\">5. Risks and Considerations Regarding Services</h3><p>Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is irrevocable. You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive. You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to assess the meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need to obtain further services from Gene Friend, your physician, a genetic counselor, or other health care provider.</p><p>We encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor, a health professional with special training in genetic conditions, prior to the collection of your sample for testing to learn more, so that you can make an informed decision about whether the test is right for you. A genetic counselor also can help you understand your results and options.</p><p>The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in errors. The laboratory may not be able to process your sample up to 3.0% of the sample if (i) your saliva sample does not contain a sufficient volume of DNA, (ii) you do not provide enough saliva sample, or (iii) the results from processing do not meet our standards for accuracy. If the processing fails for any of these reasons, the User shall, at our request, provide us with other saliva sample (the second sample), and Gene Friend will reprocess the same at no charge to the User. However, in such case, the delay time shall not be counted into the time limit for Gene Friend to conduct and complete the process. In addition, Gene Fried shall not be responsible for any and all fees or expenses incurred by you as the result of such delay.</p><p>If the User sends another sample and Gene Friend's attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful, Gene Friend will not send additional Sample Collection Kits and the User will be entitled solely and exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to Gene Friend, less shipping and handling, provided the User shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the service, except that Gene Friend shall have the right to reject to process your sample without any legal and refund responsibility for you, in any one of the circumstances as provided in the Section 3(vi) of the Letter of Consent. In addition, if the User breaches these TOS and resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the service and the processing is not successful, Gene Friend will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide the User a refund. Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable or incorrect (referred to as \"Errors\"). As this possibility is known in advance, Users are not entitled to refunds where these Errors occur.</p><p>You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of information from Gene Friend. Please make sure to discuss your Genetic Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act upon the Genetic Information resulting from Gene Friend's Services. In any case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through Gene Friend, you should contact your physician or other health care provider. Please note that genetic risk assessment is not applicable to results of carrier screening tests.</p><p> Genetic research is not comprehensive. While we measure many hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions.</p><p>Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your interests. You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others.</p><p>Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician or other health care provider may become part of your medical record and through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or insurance companies in the future.</p><p>We do not provide medical advice. The Genetic Information provided by Gene Friend is for your research and informational. The Services are not intended to be used by the User for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional medical advice. You should always seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.</p><p> Gene Friend does not endorse, warranty or guarantee the effectiveness of any specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on our Web.
