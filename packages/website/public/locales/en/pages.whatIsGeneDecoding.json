      "description": "Gene decoding uses laboratory methods to deciper deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inside your genes. Genes exist inside your cells, the are materials you are inherented from your parents. Gene decoding through genetic tests help determine matters relating to genetics such as intellectual and physical potential, behavioral tendencies, and health risks."
