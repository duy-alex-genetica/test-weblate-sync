        "2": {
          "question": "2. What is the purpose of <span>GeneNFT</span>?",
          "answer": "In addition to being a digital asset, <span>GeneNFT</span> acts as a certificate (token) that ensures the user's full ownership of their genetic data."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "3. How does <span>GeneNFT</span> work? How to own one?",
          "answer": "After conducting the Gene Decoding Service at Genetica, your genetic data will be encrypted, stored, secured and administered on the Gene Friend Network system as a digital asset. Gene Friend Network credits the ownership of this property for you."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "4. How can I check my <span>GeneNFT</span>?",
          "answer": {
            "1": "1. Download and open the Genetica app.",
            "2": "2. Accessing the Genetica app, going to the <b>Genetica Wallet</b>, opening the <span>GeneNFT</span> tab, users can:<ul><li>- See your own <span>GeneNFT</span> certificate</li><li>- Check NFT tokens directly on the blockchain network</li></ul>"
          }
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "5. Some governments have not recognized NFT as a digital asset, so is there any risk in owning it?",
          "answer": "You do not have any legal risk associated with <span>GeneNFT</span>. <span>GeneNFT</span> simplifies the ownership of your data. We digitize this ownership through NFT and leave it to you to manage."
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "6. Will <span>GeneNFT</span> help me make money, and how?",
          "answer": "<p>There is no guarantee of a person's ability to generate financial income from genetic data. To the best of our knowledge, there has never been a documented case of becoming wealthy through selling or renting one's genetic data.</p><p>However, the genetic information of a subset of individuals that are relevant to a particular field of study can help research efforts aimed at applying genetic information to areas such as personalized medicine, individualized specific drugs.. In these cases, research institutions are often willing to sponsor a small fee for access to genetic data analysis.</p><p><span>GeneNFT</span> owners have the right to allow or not allow anyone to access their genetic data, in return for a funding fee mentioned above, or simply for free in contribution to humanity's progress.</p><p>All authorized data access from the owner of the genome himself (which is yourself) is fully documented and transparent to the owner.</p>"

ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h3><p>Your use of Gene Friend's Services (excluding any services provided by Gene Friend under a separate agreement) is subject to the terms of the legal agreement between you and Gene Friend set forth in these TOS and in any and all documents incorporated herein by reference. Except as specified herein, these TOS apply to any use of the Services, including but not limited to (i) submitting a saliva sample for DNA extraction and processing, (ii) uploading a digital version of your Genetic Information and interacting with it on the Web and/or Application, and/or (iii) creating and using a free Genetica Account without providing your saliva sample or Genetic Information. In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these TOS. You may not use the Services if you do not accept these TOS. You can accept these TOS by (i) clicking to accept or agree to these TOS, where this option is made available to you by Gene Friend for any Service; or by (ii) actually using the Services. In this case, you acknowledge and agree that Gene Friend will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of these TOS from that point onwards. In addition, when using particular Services, you shall be subject to any guidelines or rules applicable to such services that may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into these TOS. Gene Friend may also offer other services from time to time that are governed by different terms of service.</p><h3>3. PREREQUISITES</h3><p>Whether or not you submit your own saliva sample, a saliva sample of anyone for whom you have legal authority to agree, or otherwise provide your own Genetic Information, you use the Services and accept these TOS only when you are eighteen (18) years of age or older and have full capacity for civil acts to agree to these TOS on behalf of yourself or those for whom you have legal authority.</p><p>Neither Gene Friend's Web/Application nor any of its Services are designed for, intended to attract, or directed toward children under the age of 18.</p><h3>4. DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES</h3><p>The Services include access to the Web and/or Application and personal genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva sample. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that augments or enhances the current Services shall be subject to these TOS. You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided \"AS-IS\" and are based on the current state of the art of genetic research and technology in use by Gene Friend at the time of the purchase or viewing. As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, Gene Friend is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its Users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Gene Friend provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Gene Friend may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to Users generally at Gene Friend's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Gene Friend when you stop using the Services. Gene Friend assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside the terms of these TOS or other applicable terms.</p><p>You are responsible for any Internet service fees as well as any device/ equipment which are necessary or required for your use of our Web and/or Application and/or Services.</p><h3>5. RISKS AND CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING SERVICES</h3><p>Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is irrevocable. You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive. You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to assess the meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need to obtain further services from Gene Friend, your physician, a genetic counselor, or other health care provider.</p><p>We encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor, a health professional with special training in genetic conditions, prior to the collection of your sample for testing to learn more, so that you can make an informed decision about whether the test is right for you. A genetic counselor also can help you understand your results and options.</p><p>The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in errors. The laboratory may not be able to process your sample up to 3.0% of the sample if (i) your saliva sample does not contain a sufficient volume of DNA, (ii) you do not provide enough saliva sample, or (iii) the results from processing do not meet our standards for accuracy. If the processing fails for any of these reasons, the User shall, at our request, provide us with other saliva sample (the second sample), and Gene Friend will reprocess the same at no charge to the User. However, in such case, the delay time shall not be counted into the time limit for Gene Friend to conduct and complete the process. In addition, Gene Friend shall not be responsible for any and all fees or expenses incurred by you as the result of such delay.</p><p>If the User sends another sample and Gene Friend's attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful, Gene Friend will not send additional Sample Collection Kits, provided the User shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the service, Gene Friend shall have the right to reject to process your sample without any legal and refund responsibility for you, in any one of the circumstances as provided in the Section 3(f) of the Letter of Consent. In addition, if the User breaches these TOS and resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the service and the processing is not successful, Gene Friend will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide the User a refund. Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable or incorrect (referred to as \"Errors\"). As this possibility is known in advance, Users are not entitled to refunds where these Errors occur.</p><p>You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of information from Gene Friend. Please make sure to discuss your Genetic Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act upon the Genetic Information resulting from Gene Friend's Services. In any case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through Gene Friend, you should contact your physician or other health care provider. Please note that genetic risk assessment is not applicable to results of carrier screening tests.</p><p>Genetic research is not comprehensive. While we measure many hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions.</p><p>Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your interests. You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others.</p><p>Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician or other health care provider may become part of your medical record and through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or insurance companies in the future.</p><p>We do not provide medical advice. The Genetic Information provided by Gene Friend is for your research and informational. The Services are not intended to be used by the User for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional medical advice. You should always seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.</p><p>Gene Friend does not endorse, warranty or guarantee the effectiveness of any specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on our Web and/or Application. If we provide to you on our Web and/or Application any recommendations that identify you, based on your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature or research, potentially actionable information, this information is intended for informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other healthcare provider.</p><h3>6. USER REPRESENTATIONS</h3><p>By accessing the Services, you agree to, acknowledge, and represent as follows:</p><p>You understand that information you learn from Gene Friend is not designed to independently diagnose, prevent, or treat any condition or disease or to ascertain the state of your health in the absence of medical and clinical information. You acknowledge that Gene Friend urges you to seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider if you have questions or concerns arising from your Genetic Information.</p><p>You give permission to Gene Friend, its Permitted Parties, successors and assignees to perform genotyping services on the DNA extracted from your saliva sample and you specifically request Gene Friend to disclose the results of analyses performed on your DNA to you and to others you specifically authorize.</p><p>You represent that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older and have full capacity for civil acts if you are providing a saliva sample or accessing your Genetic Information.</p><p>You guarantee that any saliva sample you provide is your own saliva; if you are agreeing to these TOS on behalf of a person for whom you have legal authorization, you confirm that the saliva sample provided will be the saliva of that person.</p><p>You agree that any saliva sample you provide and all resulting data may be transferred and/or processed outside the country in which you reside.</p><p>You take responsibility for all possible consequences resulting from your sharing with others access to your Genetic Information and your Self-Reported Information.</p><p>Waiver of Property Rights: You understand that by providing any sample, having your Genetic Information processed, accessing your Genetic Information, or providing your Self-Reported Information, you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products that may be developed by Gene Friend or its collaborating partners. You specifically understand that you will not receive compensation for any research or commercial products that include or result from your Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information.</p><h3>7.

The Services are for use only in the country to which your Sample Collection Kit was shipped from Gene Friend.</p><p>After you have purchased our Service(s), you will create a password and Genetica Account designation. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Genetica Account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or Genetica Account. If you allow third parties to access the Web and/or Application through your username and password, you will defend and indemnify Gene Friend, its Permitted Party and any of its other affiliates against any liability, costs, or damages, including attorney fees, arising out of claims or suits by such third parties based upon or relating to such access and/or use. You agree to: (i) immediately notify Gene Friend of any unauthorized use of your password, your Genetica Account and/or any other breach of security, and (ii) ensure that you exit from your Genetica Account at the end of each session. Gene Friend cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.</p><h3>8. GENE FRIEND PRIVACY STATEMENT AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h3><p>Please read the Gene Friend's Privacy Statement and Disclosure of Information available at<a href=\"https://genetica.asia/privacy-policy\">https://genetica.asia/privacy-policy</a>carefully to understand how Gene Friend collects, processes, stores, uses and discloses information about Users and how to update or change your Personal Information and how we communicate with you.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that Gene Friend has the right to monitor any use of its systems by its personnel at any time and maintain copies documenting such monitoring.

In case of your breach of any one of these agreements Gene Friend has the right to suspend or terminate your Genetica Account and refuse any and all your current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) and you will defend and indemnify Gene Friend, its Permitted Party and any of its other affiliates against any liability, costs, or damages arising out of the breach of the representation.</p><p>If you violate the terms of this Section and/or Gene Friend has a reasonable ground to suspect that you have violated the terms of this Section, Gene Friend has the right to suspend or terminate your Genetica Account and refuse any and all your current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof).</p><h3>10.
